# OOP Final Project - MFC painter

Submitted by Yarin Ifargan and Dudi Kreis.

* We used OOP principles to create a painter with 10 figures (3 levels of inheritance).
* We used MFC - Microsoft Foundation Class - C++ object-oriented library for developing desktop applications for Windows. Read more about MFC: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/mfc-desktop-applications?view=msvc-170

Here you can see the classes hierarchy:

* In the lower left corner we have the design options - filling colors (3 sliders with a range of colors
(red, green and blue) between 0 to 255 like in RGB), and a bold option for the frame.
* In addition, we can drag a shape by clicking somewhere inside of the shape.
* At last, we can use the undo, redo and clear buttons, and also we can save our creations or load others.
